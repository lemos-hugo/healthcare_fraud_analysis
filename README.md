# Healthcare Fraud Analysis

## Overview
This is a comprehensive data science project analyzing healthcare fraud patterns to develop an automated detection system for identifying potentially fraudulent providers - using advanced machine learning and network analysis to protect healthcare resources while minimizing false positives affecting legitimate providers.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Healthcare Provider Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Size**: 558,211 total claims across 5,410 healthcare providers
- **Variables**: Provider IDs, Patient Demographics, Diagnosis Codes, Financial Claims, Chronic Conditions
- **Time Period**: Multi-year healthcare claims data with temporal patterns
- **Target**: Provider-level fraud classification (9.4% fraud rate)

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, networkx
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Neural Networks
- **Analysis**: Unsupervised clustering, network analysis, temporal pattern detection
- **Visualization**: Statistical plots, network graphs, geographic mapping

## Key Features
- **Price Structure Analysis**: Log-log modeling reveals economies of scale (RÂ² = 0.540)
- **Neighborhood Segmentation**: Premium vs value area identification (156% price gap)
- **Quality Impact Assessment**: Quality ratings correlation with pricing
- **Investment Analysis**: Student rental market opportunity with 8.7% projected ROI

## Key Findings

### Model Performance
- **Best Model**: Neural Network achieving **90.4% AUC**
- **Feature Importance**: Total reimbursement (16%), revenue (14%), deductibles (12%)
- **Cross-Validation**: Consistent performance across multiple algorithms
- **Class Balance**: Successfully handled 9.4% fraud rate through advanced sampling

### Fraud Pattern Analysis

| Pattern Type | Finding | Business Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Financial Anomalies** | Higher reimbursement variability in fraudulent providers | Enables automated outlier detection |
| **Network Behavior** | Fraudulent providers maintain normal connectivity patterns | Requires sophisticated relationship analysis |
| **Temporal Consistency** | Stable fraud rates across business hours (0.58 vs 0.57) | 24/7 monitoring capability needed |
| **Service Distribution** | 12.8x more outpatient claims require tailored detection | Separate models for service types |

### Provider Clustering Results
- **7 Distinct Clusters** identified through unsupervised analysis
- **Clusters 3 & 5**: Highest fraud concentration (>90% fraud rate)
- **Cluster 1**: Largest legitimate group (51.2% of providers)
- **PCA Variance**: 56% explained by first two components

### Geographic & Demographic Insights
- **Age Patterns**: Chronic conditions peak at 65-70 years (18.5 average conditions)
- **Service Usage**: Strong correlation between age, conditions, and claim frequency
- **State Variations**: Significant geographic concentration enabling targeted monitoring
- **Provider Networks**: Complex referral patterns requiring graph-based analysis

## Business Applications

### Fraud Detection Framework
- **Two-Stage System**: High-sensitivity screening + precision classification
- **Risk Scoring**: Real-time provider risk assessment
- **Investigation Prioritization**: Financial impact-based case ranking
- **False Positive Minimization**: Protecting legitimate provider operations

### Operational Impact
- **Automated Screening**: 80% of initial fraud detection automated
- **Cost Reduction**: 60% decrease in investigation costs through targeting
- **Early Detection**: Proactive identification of emerging fraud patterns
- **Compliance**: Explainable AI for regulatory requirements

## Strategic Recommendations

### High-Priority Actions
- Deploy **provider risk scorecards** using top-performing Neural Network model
- Implement **network monitoring** for fraud ring detection
- Establish **geographic heat maps** for regional fraud concentration
- Create **real-time scoring** infrastructure for new claims

### Monitoring Framework
- **High Risk**: Clusters 3 & 5, extreme financial outliers, suspicious network patterns
- **Medium Risk**: New providers, temporal deviations, cross-state patient flows
- **Low Risk**: Established legitimate providers with consistent patterns

## Model Performance

| Model | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Neural Network** | **0.904** | 0.89 | 0.85 | 0.87 |
| XGBoost | 0.893 | 0.91 | 0.82 | 0.86 |
| Random Forest | 0.846 | 0.78 | 0.88 | 0.83 |
| SVM | 0.835 | 0.85 | 0.79 | 0.82 |
